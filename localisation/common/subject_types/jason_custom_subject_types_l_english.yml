 imperial_city_long_desc: "An §Imperial City§! is a municipality that is directly ruled by the central government. These are typically large metropolises that have comparable power, population, and wealth as that of an entire subject nation. Comparable to free cities in the Holy Roman Empire, these cities are often granted a certain degree of autonomy and privileges. They are often used as a means to control over highly productive urban cities that require a certain degree of decentralization for various reasons. Metropolises that reside in core regions are typically directly annexed into the empire, whereas important cities far away from the capital can often be granted the status of an imperial city."

More than a mere colony nor standard dominion, a consolidated dominion is basically all but an annexed piece of land that is under direct administration by its overlord. Consolidated dominions have the similar level of de jure obedience to their overlord as that of a real union junior partner or an administrative region. However, just like with normal dominions, Consolidated Dominions focus more on colonizing, growth, and market expansion. These are large swaths of territory under direct imperial control, which are meant to colonize the new world, exert our political influence abroad, and set up lucrative ventures. Far more expansionist, and nationbuilding oriented than a trade outpost or commercial enterprise. Far more centrally controlled than a dominion or a colony, and with a stronger focus on constant expansion than a vassal or march."

chinese_imperial_altar_states_long_desc: "A §YChinese Imperial Altar State§! is a state that is directly controlled by the last surviving patriach of the previous ruling dynasty as a small fiefdom where they can live out the rest of their days in quiet comfort and luxury, sponsored by the state. They are expected to devote their time to praying for their defeated ancestors and their vanquished state in the traditional filial and Confucian manner. They are prohibited from forming any meaningful military arms and are also severely limited in their ability to conduct foreign policy nor even set internal laws. Instead, an imperial governor is appointed to oversee the actual administraton of the land. The fief holder is merely a beneficiary to the majority of the state's revenues, as a stipend to both bribe them into not rebelling, and as a way to pay for the costs of praying for their ancestors.\n\nChinese Empires often the surviving members of vanquished states a tiny fiefdom to rule over so they can have some income and spend their times praying for their ancestors rather than causing trouble. \nThese states are completely subservient to the Empire, but often do not provide much value and thus are given near total autonomy. But they are surveiled carefully and lack any significant ability to conduct diplomacy, foreign affairs, or military action. Their abilities to govern their fiefdom is also severely limited, as they are expected to be little more than mocks who spend their days praying for their ancestors. Their lands are still part of the official imperial system and are still subject to the laws of the land and will also have an imperial Governor appointed in parallel with the fief lord to make sure the day to day administration of the region is still done properly.\nThe feudal lords of these altar states are essentially not really the true leaders, and are only the de jure head of state, with the imperial governor (and the Emperor himself by extension) acting as the de facto head of government. However, since these fiefdoms conduct nearly 0 interactions with other states, there is no real de facto head of state. The head of government (imperial governor) basically just runs the entire government with the Emperor's approval, and the fief lord simply benefits from the rights to a huge portion of the fief's income in return for their loyalty and obligated prayers for the vanquished Ming dynastic ancestors.\nIronically, they are paid by the new dynasty but technically work for their old dynasty, in a confucian arrangement to keep the peace and provide proper respect for both the dead people and the conquered state."
